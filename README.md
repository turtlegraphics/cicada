# cicada
This simulates a cicada population with broods of various periods.

It should be able to reproduce work by Yoshimura et al., "Selection for Prime Number
Intervals in a Numerical Model of Periodical Cicada Evolution." (2008)  But I can't get
the same results.

On the other hand, it implements a couple of very simple models that do result
in broods with large prime periods.
